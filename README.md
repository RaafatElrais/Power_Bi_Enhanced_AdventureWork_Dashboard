# ⚡ Power BI – AdventureWorks 2022 Advanced Dashboard

### 📘 Project Overview
This project takes the **AdventureWorks 2022** dataset to a new level of business intelligence.  
It analyzes sales growth, category performance, and product-level profitability using **multi-page navigation** and **advanced DAX modeling**.  
The goal was to transform static data into a **dynamic analytical experience** that empowers strategic decision-making.

---

### ⚠️ Business Challenge
The company needed clear, data-driven answers to:
- Where is sales growth actually coming from?  
- Which products and categories are under or overperforming?  
- How can stakeholders explore KPIs interactively across sales, category, and product levels?

Lack of clarity in the existing reports made it hard to align sales strategy, marketing budgets, and operational priorities.

---

### 💡 Approach
- Connected and cleaned multiple datasets using **SQL** and **Power Query**.  
- Built a structured **data model** linking Orders, Products, Categories, Subcategories, and Salespersons.  
- Created **custom DAX measures** for:
  - Sales Growth %  
  - Unit Price & Quantity trends  
  - Category contribution and profitability  
- Designed a **multi-page Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Overview  
  - Sales Analysis  
  - Product Analysis  
  - Drill-Through navigation  
- Added advanced visuals: decomposition trees, scatter plots, and dynamic navigation buttons.
